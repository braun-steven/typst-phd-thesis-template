    title: "Gods as Topological Invariants",
    authors: ("Daniel Schoch",),
    venue: "Journal of Theoretical Topology and Theology, Vol. 3 (Special Issue on Metaphysics)",
    year: 2012, pages: 4,
    abstract: [We show that the number of gods in a universe must equal the Euler characteristics of its underlying manifold. By incorporating the classical cosmological argument for creation, this result builds a bridge between theology and physics and makes theism a testable hypothesis. Theological implications are profound since the theorem gives us new insights in the topological structure of heavens and hells. Recent astronomical observations can not reject theism, but data are slightly in favour of atheism.],
    contributions-par: [This work represents a groundbreaking attempt to formalize theological concepts through the rigorous mathematical framework of algebraic topology. The key insight was recognizing that divine entities could be modeled as topological invariants, allowing for the application of powerful mathematical tools to questions traditionally considered outside the realm of empirical science. The proof that the number of gods equals the Euler characteristic provides a testable hypothesis that bridges the gap between faith and reason.]

    title: "Astrology in the Era of Exoplanets",
    authors: ("Michael B. Lund",),
    venue: "Proceedings of the Celestial Computation Conference (C3), Vol. II",
    year: 2016, pages: 8,
    abstract: [The last two decades have seen the number of known exoplanets increase from a small handful to nearly 2000 known exoplanets, thousands more planet candidates, and several upcoming missions that are expected to further increase the population of known exoplanets. Beyond the strictly scientific questions that this has led to regarding planet formation and frequency, this has also led to broader questions such as the philosophical implications of life elsewhere in the universe and the future of human civilization and space exploration. One additional realm that hasn't been adequately considered, however, is that this large increase in exoplanets would also impact claims regarding astrology. In this paper we look at the distribution of planets across the sky and along the Ecliptic, as well as the current and future implications of this planet distribution.],
    contributions-par: [This work addresses a critical gap in both astronomical and astrological research by examining how the explosion in exoplanet discoveries affects traditional astrological frameworks. The key contribution was developing a mathematical model to map the distribution of exoplanets onto traditional astrological houses and signs, revealing potential systematic biases in horoscope calculations that previously only considered solar system bodies. This interdisciplinary approach opens new avenues for both astronomy and astrology.]

    title: "Stopping GAN Violence: Generative Unadversarial Networks",
    authors: ("Samuel Albanie", "Sébastien Ehrhardt", "João F. Henriques"),
    venue: "Harmony in Machine Learning Symposium (HiML), 2017",
    year: 2017, pages: 10,
    abstract: [While the costs of human violence have attracted a great deal of attention from the research community, the effects of the network-on-network (NoN) violence popularised by Generative Adversarial Networks have yet to be addressed. In this work, we quantify the financial, social, spiritual, cultural, grammatical and dermatological impact of this aggression and address the issue by proposing a more peaceful approach which we term Generative Unadversarial Networks (GUNs). Under this framework, we simultaneously train two models: a generator G that does its best to capture whichever data distribution it feels it can manage, and a motivator M that helps G to achieve its dream. Fighting is strictly verboten and both models evolve by learning to respect their differences. The framework is both theoretically and electrically grounded in game theory, and can be viewed as a winner-shares-all two-player game in which both players work as a team to achieve the best score. Experiments show that by working in harmony, the proposed model is able to claim both the moral and log-likelihood high ground.],
    contributions-par: [This work addresses the often-overlooked issue of violence in machine learning, specifically the adversarial nature of GAN training. The key innovation was replacing the adversarial framework with a cooperative one, where models support rather than attack each other. The development of the "motivator" network concept represents a paradigm shift from competitive to collaborative machine learning, with implications for both model performance and AI ethics.]

    title: "Science Spoofs, Physics Pranks and Astronomical Antics",
    authors: ("Douglas Scott",),
    venue: "Annals of Scientific Whimsy, Vol. 12",
    year: 2021, pages: 35,
    abstract: [Some scientists take themselves and their work very seriously. However, there are plenty of cases of humour being combined with science. Here I review some examples from the broad fields of physics and astronomy, particularly focusing on practical jokes and paper parodies. This is a mostly serious overview of a non-serious subject, but I'd like to claim that there is in fact some connection between humour and creativity in the physical sciences.],
    contributions-par: [This work represents the first comprehensive survey of humor in the physical sciences, documenting everything from April Fool's papers to laboratory pranks. The key contribution was establishing a taxonomy of scientific humor and demonstrating its correlation with research creativity. The paper argues that humor serves as an important creative outlet and thinking tool in scientific discovery, challenging the notion that science must be entirely serious to be rigorous.]
